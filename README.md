technical challenge for tractian hiring process

## How it work

This application is a tool for visualizing and searching assets and components of a company in a tree structure, such as locations and sensors.

This application utilizes several advanced techniques to manage and display large datasets effectively, including:

- Bloc State Management.
- Isolate for Concurrent Data Processing To handle performance-intensive tasks like filtering and searching through large sets of assets and components.
- Search and Filtering with Debouncing.
- Recursive Filtering Algorithm.

These techniques together provide a robust and scalable solution for managing and visualizing complex datasets in real time while maintaining high performance and responsiveness.

## Improvement points:
- Display search or filter progress to the user.
- Ensure that text search operates on the results of the "energy sensor" and "critical" filters.
- Improve code clarity.
